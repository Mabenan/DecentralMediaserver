# Decentral Mediaserver

This is client programm which makes it possible to organize your media files in way a mediaserver would do with the plus that you don't need a runing server.

Well ok you need a server where you store your pictures and a mysql server where the informations are stored but the rest runs on the client this makes it possible to use this on old nas which don't have enough power or the operating system to run an own mediaserver.
