This is a project for creating your first electron desktop app. You can use this to easily setup your basic electron + angular project files for your development.

Currently runs with:

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) v6.0.8
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/v2.0.5) v2.0.5
- [Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/tree/v20.25.0) v20.25.0

With this sample, you can :

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

## Development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Now you can experience a fast way of developing desktop apps using `Angular` + `Electron` with hot swaping and hot reloading.

This package includes a basic boiler plate example code for an `Electron` App using `Angular`. With this basic example you can develop your app using `Angular` and package it with `Electron` window as a desktop App. The `Electron` codes are managed by `main.ts` file on your root directory.

Developing with this package make it easy because its enable you to change your code and its automatically update on your `Electron` App. This package eliminates the repetition of closing and running again of you `Electron` App. You can change codes and see it update your apps in a couple of seconds.
