[![Electron Logo](https://electronjs.org/images/electron-logo.svg)](https://electron.atom.io/)

Currently runs with:

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) v6.0.8
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/v2.0.5) v2.0.5
- [Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/tree/v20.25.0) v20.25.0

With this sample, you can :

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
